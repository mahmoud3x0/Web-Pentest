## Introduction

Clickjacking is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives. This script helps identify potential clickjacking vulnerabilities in web applications and provides an option to create a proof-of-concept exploit script.

## Features

- Detects potential clickjacking vulnerabilities by analyzing HTTP response headers.
- Generates a proof-of-concept exploit script for further testing.
- Provides user-friendly command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests module (install using `pip install requests`)

## Usage

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/clickjacking-detector.git
```
Navigate to the directory containing the script:
```bash
cd clickjacking-detector
```
Run the script:
```bash
python clickjacking_detector.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter the target URL and choose whether to create an exploit script.

###Example:
Enter the target URL: https://example.com
