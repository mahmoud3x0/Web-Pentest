# CORS Vulnerability Scanner

This script is designed to detect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfigurations in web applications. CORS misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing unauthorized access to resources from different origins.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`


## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
2. Run the script using Python:

`python cors_scanner.py`

3. Follow the prompts to input the target URL and your session cookie.

## Functionality

The script performs the following tasks:

- Checks the validity of the URL format.
- Sends HTTP requests with different origin headers to detect CORS misconfigurations.
- Identifies potential vulnerabilities such as wildcard reflection, malicious domain reflection, null origin reflection, etc.
- Provides feedback on potential CORS misconfigurations.

## Example

```python
python cors_scanner.py

mathematica

Enter the target URL: https://example.com
Enter your session cookie: your_cookie_value
